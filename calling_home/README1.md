NLRB (National Labor Relations Board) Considerations

Calling Home is designed to respect rights protected under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) and guidance enforced by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).

What this means in practice
	•	No surveillance of protected activity
This tool does not monitor, track, analyze, or infer employee communications, organizing activity, or protected concerted activity.
	•	No coercive or retaliatory use
Calling Home must not be used to intimidate, pressure, threaten, or retaliate against employees, contractors, or representatives for engaging in protected activities such as:
	•	discussing wages, hours, or working conditions
	•	union organizing or collective action
	•	communicating with labor representatives or government agencies
	•	Message generation only
The application only generates message drafts and consent records. It does not send messages, automate outreach, or enforce employer policies. Any downstream use is the responsibility of the user.
	•	Consent-first design
The built-in opt-in requirement and follow-up gating are intentional safeguards to reduce the risk of:
	•	unlawful coercion
	•	unfair labor practices
	•	misuse in employer–employee contexts

Employer responsibility

If Calling Home is used by an employer, manager, or organization:
	•	Ensure communications do not interfere with employees’ NLRA-protected rights
	•	Avoid use during labor disputes, organizing campaigns, or investigations without legal review
	•	Consult qualified labor counsel before deploying any communication strategy that could affect employees or their representatives

Disclaimer

Calling Home is a general-purpose text generation tool.
It does not provide legal advice and does not guarantee compliance with the NLRA, NLRB rulings, or state labor laws. Users are solely responsible for ensuring lawful and ethical use.
