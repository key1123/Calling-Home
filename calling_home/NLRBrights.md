Best Practices for NLRB / NLRA-Sensitive Communications

Communications that involve employees, contractors, or worker representatives can implicate rights protected under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) and enforced by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). Even well-intentioned outreach can raise concerns if it is perceived as coercive, surveillant, or retaliatory. The following expert guidance reflects widely accepted labor-law compliance practices.

⸻

1. Understand What Is Protected Activity

Under the NLRA, employees have the right to engage in protected concerted activity, which includes—but is not limited to:
	•	Discussing wages, benefits, hours, or working conditions
	•	Communicating with coworkers about workplace issues
	•	Supporting or opposing union organization
	•	Communicating with labor representatives or government agencies

Expert insight:
Protection applies whether or not a union is present and often extends to non-traditional communication channels.

2. Avoid Surveillance or the Appearance of Surveillance

Expert practice strongly cautions against:
	•	Monitoring employee communications
	•	Tracking responses to labor-related messages
	•	Creating logs that could be interpreted as surveillance of protected activity

Calling Home is intentionally designed to:
	•	Generate message drafts only
	•	Avoid analytics, monitoring, or behavior tracking
	•	Leave all decisions and interpretations to the user

3. Use Neutral, Non-Coercive Language

When drafting messages that could reach employees or worker representatives:
	•	Avoid directives, ultimatums, or implied consequences
	•	Avoid language suggesting discipline, retaliation, or job impact
	•	Avoid conditional phrasing tied to cooperation or silence

Expert guidance:
Even subtle phrasing can be construed as coercive when power imbalances exist (e.g., employer-employee relationships).

4. Separate Information from Advocacy

Experts recommend clearly distinguishing between:
	•	Informational communications (neutral facts, process explanations), and
	•	Persuasive or advocacy communications (opinions, encouragement, discouragement)

When in doubt:
	•	Limit messages to factual, process-oriented information
	•	Avoid commentary on unionization, collective action, or employee choices

⸻

5. Respect Timing and Context

The context of a message can be as important as its content. Expert practice advises extra caution:
	•	During organizing campaigns
	•	During labor disputes or negotiations
	•	During investigations, grievances, or complaints

Best practice:
If labor-related activity is ongoing, pause outreach and consult labor counsel before communicating.

6. Avoid Selective or Targeted Pressure

Messages should not:
	•	Single out employees based on perceived labor views
	•	Apply different messaging standards to different groups
	•	Escalate pressure through repeated contact

Calling Home’s consent-first design and manual drafting workflow help reduce these risks.

7. Employer and Manager Use Requires Heightened Care

If used by employers, supervisors, or management:
	•	Remember that communications may carry inherent authority
	•	What feels like a request may be perceived as a directive
	•	Even optional language can be interpreted as pressure

Expert recommendation:
Have labor counsel review messaging strategies that could affect employees’ protected rights.

Final Reminder

NLRB-sensitive communications require care, restraint, and awareness of employee rights.
Best practices focus on neutrality, consent, non-surveillance, and respect for protected activity.

Calling Home is a general-purpose drafting tool and does not make determinations about NLRA compliance.
