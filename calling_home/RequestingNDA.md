Best Practices When Requesting a Copy of an NDA

Requesting a copy of a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) is a common and legitimate action, but it should be handled carefully to avoid misunderstandings, legal risk, or reputational harm. The following best practices reflect widely accepted professional, legal, and compliance standards.

1. Confirm the Basis for the Request

Before making the request, ensure that one or more of the following applies:
	•	You are a signatory to the NDA
	•	The NDA was referenced as governing your relationship or obligations
	•	You are requesting the document for personal records, compliance review, or clarification of duties

If none of these apply, consult legal counsel before proceeding.

2. Use Neutral, Non-Adversarial Language

Expert practice emphasizes requesting, not demanding.
The tone should be:
	•	Professional
	•	Calm
	•	Non-accusatory

Avoid language that implies:
	•	Breach of contract
	•	Legal threats
	•	Enforcement action

Why this matters:
Even a routine request can be interpreted as coercive or adversarial if phrased improperly, particularly in employment or contractor relationships.

3. Clearly State the Purpose — and Limit the Scope

A best practice is to explain why you are requesting the NDA without expanding the request beyond the document itself.

Examples of appropriate purposes:
	•	Record-keeping
	•	Internal compliance review
	•	Clarifying ongoing obligations
	•	Verifying terms previously referenced

Avoid requesting:
	•	Additional confidential materials
	•	Side agreements
	•	Oral understandings or informal assurances

4. Respect Voluntary Disclosure Unless Contractually Required

Unless the NDA explicitly requires one party to provide copies upon request:
	•	Treat the request as voluntary
	•	Be prepared for the recipient to suggest an alternative process (e.g., HR, legal, records department)
	•	Do not escalate through repeated follow-ups if the request is declined

Expert note:
Persistence after a refusal can create unnecessary legal or labor-related risk.

5. Follow Consent and Communication Laws

If the request is made via SMS or email, experts recommend:
	•	Obtaining consent before follow-up messages
	•	Honoring opt-outs immediately
	•	Avoiding repeated or automated outreach

Calling Home’s opt-in gating is designed to support this best practice.

6. Do Not Interpret or Rely on the NDA Without Review

Once a copy is obtained:
	•	Do not assume enforceability, scope, or validity
	•	Do not rely on memory or informal summaries
	•	If obligations affect employment, business decisions, or disclosures, consult qualified legal counsel

Important:
NDAs vary widely by jurisdiction, date, and context. Expert practice is to treat each agreement as unique.

⸻

7. Maintain Professional Records

Experts recommend:
	•	Retaining the NDA in a secure location
	•	Documenting when and how the copy was obtained
	•	Avoiding redistribution unless expressly permitted

Calling Home intentionally does not store NDA documents to reduce data-handling risk.

Final Reminder

Requesting a copy of an NDA is a reasonable and often necessary step, but how the request is made matters.
Using a respectful tone, limiting scope, honoring consent, and avoiding escalation aligns with professional standards and reduces legal exposure.
